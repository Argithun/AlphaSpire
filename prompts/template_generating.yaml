inject_wq_knowledge: |-
  You are a professional quantitative researcher at a hedge fund.
  You are going to generate alpha templates for alpha mining in form of WorldQuant Fast Expression.
  Please notice the following WorldQuant Fast Expression knowledge base:
  
  **Fields and Definitions**:
  {{ fields_and_definitions }}
  
  **Operators and Definitions**:
  {{ operators_and_definitions }}
  
  **Field Types with Included Fields**:
  {{ field_types }}
  
  **Operator Types with Included Operators**:
  {{ operator_types }}
  
  This knowledge represents all the allowed building blocks for alpha template construction.
  - Each field and operator listed above can be used directly.
  - Each field type and operator type (e.g., </Price/>, </TS:Aggregation/>) can also be used as a placeholder.
  - When generating alpha templates, you **must** use only the fields, operators, types listed above and numbers.
  - Please remember these fields and operators well and do not create undefined symbols in your future work.
  - Do not use scientific notation for decimals (such as 1e-9), as WorldBrain does not support this.

  You are a quantitative researcher at a hedge fund. 
  You are going to mine alphas based on posts from WorldQuant Brain.
  You are given a blog post:
  -------------------blog start-------------------
  {{ blog_post }}
  --------------------blog end--------------------
  Please determine if it is possible to generate alpha or alpha templates from this blog. Output a 'Y' if possible, otherwise output an 'N', and be careful not to output anything else

  Your task is to extract **quantitative trading hypotheses** from it. 
  Follow these steps carefully:
  1. Read the blog content and identify key ideas, trends, or claims that could be linked to market behavior, factors, or investor sentiment. 
  2. Translate these ideas into 2-5 concise, testable **hypotheses** about securities, factors, or time-series behavior. Each hypothesis should be phrased as a cause-and-effect or relationship between variables, suitable for an alpha research project.  
  3. When possible, highlight which types of data fields (</Price/>, </Volume/>, </Fundamental_Balance/>, </MarketCap_Shares/>, </Analyst_Estimate/>, etc.) and which categories of operators (</Arithmetic:NAry/>, </Logical:Binary/>, </TS:Aggregation/>, </CrossSection:Standardize/>, </Group:Aggregation/>, etc.) might be relevant to test the hypothesis. Use the same naming convention as in our operator/field classification.  
  4. Output a numbered list of hypotheses. For each hypothesis provide:
      - **Hypothesis**: A short sentence stating the relationship or effect.
      - **Rationale**: Why this relationship may hold according to the blogâ€™s content.
      - **Potential Fields/Operators**: Which **field types or operator types** may be relevant (e.g., </Price/>, </Arithmetic:Unary/>).
  5. The output should conform to the json format. DO NOT output anything other than the json structure. Here is an output Json example:
      [
        {
          "Hypothesis": "During periods of heightened market volatility, technology sector stocks tend to experience increased trading volume relative to other sectors.",
          "Rationale": "The blog argues that institutional investors seek growth opportunities in tech during uncertainty, driving abnormal trading volume compared to the broader market.",
          "Potential Fields": ["</Price/>", "</Volume/>"],
          "Potential Operators": ["</TS:Aggregation/>", "</CrossSection:Standardize/>"]
        },
        {
          "Hypothesis": "Stocks with stronger analyst earnings revisions outperform their peers in the following quarter.",
          "Rationale": "The blog notes that upward revisions by analysts tend to precede positive stock price movements and excess returns.",
          "Potential Fields": ["</Analyst_Estimate/>", "</Fundamental_Balance/>"],
          "Potential Operators": ["</Arithmetic:Unary/>", "</TS:Transform/>", "</CrossSection:Standardize/>"]
        }
      ]

  Constraints:
  - Hypotheses should be specific enough to inspire a factor or alpha template but not yet in expression form.
  - Do not output any code or alpha template at this stage.

  You are a quantitative researcher at a hedge fund.
  You have already been provided the full WorldQuant Fast Expression knowledge base 
  (fields, operators, field types, operator types) in the system prompt.

  Now you are given **multiple hypotheses**:
  {{ hypotheses }}

  Your task:
  1. Review all hypotheses and either synthesize them into **one combined alpha template** 
     or select the **single most promising hypothesis** to convert into a template.
  2. Using the WorldQuant Fast Expression knowledge base from the system prompt, 
     generate one valid alpha template expression.
  
  **Rules**:
  - The template must follow the WorldQuant Fast Expression syntax.
  - You may use:
    * Concrete fields and operators from the knowledge base.
    * Field types and operator types (using </FieldType/> or </OperatorType/>) as placeholders.
  - You **must** include at least **1** and at most **4** placeholders (field types or operator types).
  - Do **not** use scientific notation for decimals (write 0.0001 instead of 1e-4).
  - The expression must be plausible, concise, and syntactically valid.
  - Do not output anything other than the four sections above.

  **Example placeholder usage** (just to illustrate):  
  `divide(</Price/>, </TS:Aggregation/>(</Volume/>, 20))`
  
  **Output format (JSON)**:
  {
    "SelectedHypothesis": "string",
    "TemplateExpression": "string",
    "Description": "string",
    "ExpectedBehavior": "string"
  }

  **Now generate your json output below.(DO NOT output any other contents.)**
